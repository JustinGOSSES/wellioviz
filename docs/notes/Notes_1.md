## process to clone wellioviz, install wellio.js locally and use both together

- Clone wellioviz repo
- CD into wellioviz top-level directory
- run `npm install wellio -g` . This will install wellio which wellioviz uses
- run `node`
- In node environment now, run `wellio = require("wellio")`
- In node environment run, `wellioviz = require("dist/index.js")`
- Now you should have both wellio and wellioviz as objects with functions you can call.
